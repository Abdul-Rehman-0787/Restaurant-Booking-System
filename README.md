# Restaurant-Booking-System
This Python program implements a basic client-server architecture using the socket library with a TCP connection. The system consists of two separate files: one for the server and one for the client. To run the application, first start the server, then launch the client interface.

The server is configured to handle up to five active clients simultaneously. An additional ten clients can wait in a queue for connection. Any further connection attempts beyond that will wait until space becomes available.

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making the system easy to operate.
